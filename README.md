Idea:
Convert a bike into e-bike using a hub motor, existing ESC and a battery.
Added components: brake and throttle.

Goal of this project is to generate the control signal for the ESC according to the inputs.

Functional features:
- read the throttle
- read the brake
- generate control pulses for the ESC

Secondary features:
- calibrate throttle range
- acceleration curve
- cruise speed with extra input
